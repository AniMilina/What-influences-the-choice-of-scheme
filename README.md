# What-influences-the-choice-of-scheme

This project aims to study the performance of different coverage schemes in American football defense.   
The focus is on how factors such as defender strikes, hurries, sacks, types of blocks, and the number of defenders near the scrimmage affect the scheme.   
The project will analyze data from pff_passCoverage and identify trends and patterns in the relationship between these factors and the result of the pass.   
The goal is to determine which actions and events have the greatest impact on the game scheme.
